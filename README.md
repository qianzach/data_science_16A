# Data Science 16A Repository

This is a repository of the homework and projects I completed while taking **Applications in Python: Data Science** with Professor Phil Chodrow at UCLA. 

**Note: This is purely to display my works. Any sort of academic dishonesty is prohibited and will not be tolerated.**
