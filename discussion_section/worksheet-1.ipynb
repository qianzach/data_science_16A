The point is to get you oriented with your groups,  with Jupyter notebooks, and with the introductory content of the Monday lectures (numbers, strings, lists) without weighing you down with having to write any complex code. Problem 1 will illustrate some very important theory, which can otherwise remain hidden when you write code until you run into problems, so make sure that you understand it well.\n",

Don't split up the worksheets and do the parts independently -- this would miss the point, which is to teach you enough for the exams in a sequential manner. Working through them productively (in a way that makes you learn something) is more important than finishing every problem."
