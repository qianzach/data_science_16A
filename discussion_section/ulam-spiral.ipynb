    "for i, j, k in spiral(5):\n",

    "1 1 5\n",
    "#...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two numbers give the **coordinates** of a square, while the third number gives the integer corresponding to that square. For example, the number `1` corresponds to `(2,2)`, the number `4` corresponds to `(2,1)`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start at `(2,2)` because this is the middle of a `5x5` grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to compare to the first diagram to convince yourself that the sample output shown above does indeed correspond to the spiral pattern shown. "

    "We are now going to implement the `spiral()` generator. If you investigate the first diagram in this assignment, you'll observe that, after starting in the middle, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We take **one** step right, then turn left (so now we are facing up). We take **one** step up, then turn left again (so now we are facing left). \n",

    "1. `spiral()` should accept a single argument `n`, an odd integer. Check that `n` is an integer, and raise a `TypeError` if not. Then, check that `n` is *odd*, and raise a `ValueError` if not. \n",
    "1. Start with a variable  `pos = (m,m)`, where `m = int((n-1)/2)` is the midpoint of the grid. Additionally, initialize a variable `k = 1` to log the current integer, and a `direction` tuple with `(0,1)` indicating the direction we are facing. Finally, initialize a `length` variable with value `1`. \n",
    "2. **Main loop:**\n",
    "    1. As long as `k <= n**2 - 1`\n",
    "        1. Do the following twice (that is, do i and ii, then do i and ii again). \n",
    "            1. Take a number of steps equal to `length`. In a step, we add the current `direction` to the current position `pos` entrywise. After each step, if `k <= n**2`, yield `(pos[0], pos[1], k)`, then increment `k` by one. \n",
    "            2. Change direction by making a left turn. You can do so by replacing `direction` with its value in the supplied `left_turns` dictionary. \n",
    "        2. Increment length by 1. \n",
